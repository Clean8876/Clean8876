Hello, this is Uttam Shetty!

Highly skilled in the MERN stack of technologies comprising MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, and with a strong foundation in Django and Python programming. I enjoy developing effective, scalable, and user-friendly applications. My experience is based on multiple projects where I designed, developed, and constructed full-stack solutions while contributing to frontend and backend development.
